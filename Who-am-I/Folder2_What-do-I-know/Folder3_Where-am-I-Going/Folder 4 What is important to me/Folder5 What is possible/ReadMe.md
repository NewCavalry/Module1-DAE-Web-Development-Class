I believe that anything is possible if you put your mind, heart and soul into it 
and don't give up no matter what obstacles come your way.

This is the path to my current directory: 
/Users/student/Module1/Who-am-I/Folder2_What-do-I-know/Folder3_Where-am-I-Going/Folder 
4 What is important to me/Folder5 What is possible

This is the path to my current previous directory: 
/Users/student/Module1/Who-am-I/Folder2_What-do-I-know/Folder3_Where-am-I-Going/Folder
4 What is important to me/

This is the final directory so no further path to next directory.
